{{<lead>}}
**Project Hail Mary** by Andy Weir. Really enjoyable scifi from the author of The Martian. 

**Exhalation** by Tad Chiang. A collection of short stories, the tale of the Baghdad Shop Owner was a particular favourite.

**Second Sleep** by Richard Harris. An English priest in a simpler time unravels a local mystery.
