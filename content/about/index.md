### What is this site about?
I'm trying to learn new skills and document my efforts.


### The Author

Irish, in my 40's trying to work on exciting projects. he/him.

#### What I've done

My first computer was a second-hand Commodore 64C. Even before I got it I was obsessed with computers and loved poring over magazines. 
![commodore64 computer](c64.jpg)I even took a wooden wedge-shaped block and drew a keyboard on it so I could pretend to be programming.

I loved the idea of making things. I tried to build stone axes and bows and arrows when I was 10. They barely worked and weren't practical but I did manage to get home-made weapons banned from my primary school. 

I went to college to study Science and chose Physics and Computer Science options. 
Looking back I realise that I was suffering pretty badly from anxiety and had very poor study skills. 

I dropped out.

Decades later I feel like I haven't achieved much. My CV feels embarassing. I still suffer from anxiety.

But I still have dreams of making things and learning how things work.

So lets try again. 

Let's Do things and Tell people about them.


#### What I'm going to do

I've made plenty of plans before and not made progress with them. On this site I want to report on how things have gone.

I'm interested in programming, woodwork, game development, writing and languages. 
It would be amazing to generate an income from doing something I enjoy.
