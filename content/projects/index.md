## Woodwork

I've been studying woodwork for a couple of years and am having fun designing chairs and trying to make them.

## Websites
### StrangeCharacters.com

Blogging about what I'm working on. 

Since most of my projects will be websites it made sense to start with one. Skills learned here will be useful for building other sites.

I also wanted to get into the habit of documenting things as I go, in the spirit of leaving [breadcrumbs](/articles/aw-yiss-breadcrumbs) for myself. Writing about what I'm doing helps me remember details and lets me practice passing on information to readers.
