>What do you want to do when you grow up?

#### Guidance counselling.

I went to a guidance counselor when I was about 15. He asked lots of questions, listened to my answers and eventually recommended a job for me.

**Therapist** 

I blinked a few times. 
Not what I expected.

He asked "What job do **you** think you'd like to have?"

"Games Programmer" I replied

*He* blinked a few times. 

He looked back at his notes, shrugged and offered me advice on how to get into my chosen field. 
He also recommended Systems Analysis which I got to try in college and loved. Props to my guidance counselor.

I haven't become a professional games programmer. Or a therapist.

So today I'm going to revist the guidance council.
Find purpose.

Find something that I don't completely suck at.

Let's go.


Looking at other people, whose job would I like to have?

(I promise not to kill anyone and take their job)

#### Perfect workday

I did this exercise a few years ago, thinking about what perfect day would look like.

More specifically, a perfect workday. It's easy to imagine a lottery win, being a rockstar and heading into space as amazing expereiences but what would I like to be doing day-in, day-out?

Swiping between imaginary roles, I tried to think - what do the best ones have in common?

I imagined being in a workshop, picking up a project that I've been working on for weeks. Running my hands over pieces and feeling how it joins.
Every time i finish a project I can look over it and decide where and how it could be improved.

Meeting others with similar interests and different skills and learning and teaching.


I like solving puzzles. I get huge satisfaction if something breaks and I'm able to fix it. I enjoy designing things.

A composer works on a piece until they're happy with it and then shows it to the world.
That's how I'd like to be making things.

Splitting work between time alone and collaborating with others. Having time without distractions and then getting inspired and shraring knowledge with others.

There's nothing more appealing than seeing someone talk with enthusiasm about something they care about.
I want to listen to more of that and have something to talk about myself.
Learning and teaching.


#### 
I'd have left a small task to complete so that I can get stright into working when I start the day. 
No long commute but a separate workplace from home.

Planning on paper and discussing with others 

Physical making and online aspects of a business too.

Open, sharing knowledge. Learning and teaching.

Collaborating with others. Using art as inspiration. 

A business that is more like a tree than a strip-mine.

The overlap

Work that provides some benefits other than money. If I spend years doing this will it help me and help others even if it isn't profitable?

A business around programming or languages could improve my skills for subsequent projects.
Showing how things are made would educate and inspire others to do something similar.




What exactly is my dream job? It's going to change and develop but let's look at some people who are doing something appealing today.
