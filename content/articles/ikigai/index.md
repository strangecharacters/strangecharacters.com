>What do you want to be when you grow up?

Ah, the childhood question. How would I answer it now?

>Not fucking anxious, doing something I'm happy to tell people about.

Guidance counselling.

I went to a really nice guidance counselor when I was about 15. He asked lots of questions, listened to my answers and eventually recommended a job for me.

Therapist

I blinked a few times

He asked "What job do **you** think you'd like to have?"

"Games programmer" I replied

He blinked a few times. 

He looked back at his notes, shrugged and offered me advice on how to get into my chosen field. 

He also recommended Systems Analysis which I got to try in college and loved. Props to my guidance counselor.

I haven't become a professional games programmer. Or a therapist.

So today I'm going to revist the guidance council. Look for my ikigai.

Find purpose.

Find something that I don't completely suck at.

Let's go.


Looking at other people, whose job would I like to have?

(I promise not to kill anyone and take their job)

### Perfect workday

I did this exercise a few years ago, thinking about what perfeact day would look like.

More specifically, a perfect workday. It's easy to imagine a lottery win, being a rockstar and heading into space as amazing expereiences but whoat would I like to be doing day-in, day-out?

A late start.

I have no desire for the 'up and 4 and hitting the gym before a cold plunge' life.

Waking up in a nice, comfortable house or apartment with my wife is the first thing i'd wish for.

Getting up without a schedule but looknig forward to the activities of the day.

A composer works on a piece until they're happy with it and then shows it to the world.
That's how I'd like to be making things.

An overlap between interests and benefits. 

I don't want to sell out my hobbies. To be a woodworker with clients and deadlines sounds harder than making interesting things for myself and freinds and then showing the work on youtube.
