I think I'm going to be talking about procrastination quite often.
It's been the bane of my life for a long time now.

If I'm going to leave things unfinished or interrupt myself I need to **find a way to restart**.

I'm trying to leave a **trail of breadcrumbs** that can get me back on track.

These make it easier to recover from getting sidetracked.

#### Breadcrumbs
* I have a [gratitude journal](https://nesslabs.com/gratitude) listing things I've done and things I'm grateful for every day.

I am very self critical and filling this in has helped me develop the habit of thinking about the positives.
I leave the journal next to my bed and write just before I sleep, which helps avoid ruminating and keeping me awake.
* I use [logseq](https://logseq.com) for taking notes and brainstorming on the pc.
I prefer the feel of writing ideas onto paper but logseq is great for taking notes from pdfs and youtube videos.
* I send emails to myself.
* I __like__ things on [twitter](https://twitter.com/strangechars/likes) that I might want to revisit
* My browser [history](chrome://history) or the plethora of open tabs that stretch into the distance
* I have a whiteboard in my office that I sometimes leave messages on
* If I'm reading a book that I want to refer back to I stick small post-its on the relevant page
* Sometimes I just take a picture of something with my phone, all pics get uploaded to google photos automatically.

If I was writing more code ( and I'd like to be doing that ) I could also use github as a history of work done. Hopefully with meaningful commit messages.

* [Bullet Journaling](https://bulletjournal.com) is the main way for me to list my tasks and work through them during the day. I don't decorate or do anything complicated with it, it's a form of short-term memory on paper.
