I've got one good habit that I've kept for years and it's a [gratitude journal]().



I made it a rule of thumb for myself that I wouldn't publish things about my plans on this site.
Instead I wanted to document what I had actually done. Results rather than wishes.

All my efforts seem really piecemeal and I find myself thinking that I hadn't really done anything worth writing about.

There is one good habit that I've maintained for years and that's keeping a [gratitude journal](#).

Trying to find what to write for this site I went back and read my journal entries.

Even if I didn't feel very productive here was a list of things that I had done, things that made me happy or grateful.

I had a trail of breadcrumbs to follow.

Opening up the history tab on my browser lets me see what interesting projects I had been looking at. Youtube history shows what educated and entertained.
Likes or bookmarks on twitter and even the group chats with my friends all leave evidence of something.

I find it too easy to be critical and feel bad about not achieving enough but journaling and digital breadcrumbs are a useful reminder of what I __am__ getting done.

And that's worth focusing on.
