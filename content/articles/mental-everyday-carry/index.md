The things you always bring with you. People choose the wallet, phone, watch or knife that think is most useful.

There are things I need to keep in mind for my mental health so here's my (Mental) Everyday Carry.

Physical work early in the day
Getting some gardening or other outdoor wark gives me a sense of accomplishment and sets me up for the res tof the day


Talking to myself
I'm getting much better at interrupting my anxiety by just speaking to myself in the third person
I'll be getting flustered or anxious but saying "Hey Declan, your getting a bit too worked up" in my mind is a huge help.
It breaks the chain and lets me ask "what's a better way to deal with this?"

A place to meditate
I found meditating difficult but then realised that trying it in front of my computer was far too distracting.
I cleared a space on the couch and it's become the dedicated spot for listening to some guided meditation. My counsellor pointed out that I typically seem relaxed while sitting on the couch in her office during sessions. Coincidence? I think not.

You didn't choose this
The reactions I feel, the anxieties - they're not my fault. Feeling anxious or depressed is not a moral failure.


Compassion
When things haven't gone as well as you'd hoped - be kind. If things have gone brilliantly - be kind.
COmpassion is really powerful, it helps to break down the obstacles that are in your way.
What would you do if you weren't afraid?


Recipe thinking
When you're overwhelmed, reframe the problem in terms of something familiar and soothing.
For me that's cooking. Even a very complicated recipe can be broken down into simpler steps.
Cooking is a way of focusing on something and it helps to think of other types of problems in the same way

Humour
Laughter is phyically good for you. If you need to take a break because of overwhelm, some comedy might be a useful interlude.
Making other people laugh is a great way to feel happiness and closeness.

Do things and tell people about them
Ask what other people are doing. Talking and listening gives you a chance to say and hear how things are going.
If it's a technical problem there's a tradition of rubber duck debugging that can help. 
It's happened a few times in counselling where I've figured something out or come to a conclusion but nothing has come from it until I said it out loud in a session.
Speaking out or putting things on paper can help. I don't think typing is as helpful. I've made paper notes on all of these ideas, the post is more to orgainse my thoughts.
