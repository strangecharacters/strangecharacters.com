Wake up, grab a cup of tea and something to eat. Time to start work.

Even better, time to start a business.

When I was a kid, back in the last century, I had a Commodore 64. I loved reading stories about developers that were working from their bedrooms and making money selling games that they had written themselves.


What happens next? 
A home office?
A laptop on a tropical beach?

If I'm trying to start my own business it makes sense to start something that is fulfilling, that I can enjoy for a long time.

* The process
* Side effects
* Head fakes

Asynchronous
* Plan ahead
* Make up for lost time
* Choose when to work

Write once sell twice

Make something that can last

Small teams
I don't want to dive into large scale management

Make something that gets passed down

Pass on knowledge to others
I spent so much time not being able to figure things out for myself. 
It would feel great to make education a goal of the company in the products, for the employees and even in the marketing


What kind of business would I like to create?
It's early days 

>No plan survives first contact with the enemy
>Everyone has a plan until they get punched in the face



I've got to narrow it down. 

Find what's important, what I might be good at and take into account my weaknesses.

### Asynchronous
>Time waits for no-one

Everyone who starts a business has the dream of choosing when to work or not. 

Educating and sharing
Being a teacher isn't the only way to educate. Sharing information 
Expertise

Side effects

Making not managing

Create a business that would allow you to emulate the people you admire.

What kind of business would I like to run?

Product-founder fit

Ikigai

I want a side-effect. Even if the project doesn't make any money it would still be worthwhile.
Head-fake
Asynchronous
Work around anxiety
Something that builds in value over time, not a fad.

Some collaboration for social and mental health reasons

Physical or Digital
Being location independent is important
It would be exciting to make something tangible that could last a long time.

Expertise
I can learn from anyone who has different experience than me.
As I learn I'll be finding useful things even in my mistakes.
