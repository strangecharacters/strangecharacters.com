The feeling that you're not good enough.

I started this blog with the dream of doing cool stuff, being a wise person who could pass on advice. 

But that's not authentic. I'm inexperienced and still trying to figure things out. Getting some small things done. Making attempts and mistakes in equal measure.

The only way to avoid feeling like an imposter is to be authentic. You don't waste any cycles in pretending.

[Hacker school in New York](https://www.recurse.com/social-rules#no-feigning-surprise) had a rule where you were not allowed to express surprise when someone didn't know something.

* You've **never** heard of iptables?
* You don't know how pointers work?
* How could you not know what Alt-F4 does?

Verboten. It's a way of shaming someone.

The original line that inspired me was
>Do things and tell people about them

That's a better goal than "try to sound clever"


>Instructions for living a life: Pay attention. Be astonished. Tell about it.
