I went back to college and studied Furniture Design.

And I really enjoyed telling people that. 

What do you do?
>I'm a student. I study Furniture Design.

It felt cool and interesting.

For years I hadn't had an interesting answer to the question.
>Part time work, tinkering on the internet, dreaming of starting a business...

None of that felt good. 
A student making some furniture was something tangible and unusual.

I've finished my studies for now and I'm back to not having a good answer.
>Between jobs, looking for IT work.

My CV is kinda lame. Gaps in my resume like swiss cheese.

The dream? 

I'm an entreprenuer
an artist
a woodworker
a youtuber
a blogger

Something at least tangible.

None of those roles involve getting hired or having a CV that impresses an employer.

They are just things you do. 

So I'd better do them.
