### Gratitude Journal

When I was struggling with my mental health I found something that seemed to help.

I kept a gratitude journal next to my bed.

Every night before I went to sleep I would write down some things I was grateful for that day.

At first the list was very short but I got better with practice. 

Some days I'd feel terrible and I wanted nothing more than to write down some swear words. I felt like a waste of space and I didn't think I had anything to be grateful about.

On those days I just wrote
> Remembered to write in my journal

I don't know if keeping the journal was the __cause__ of any improvements I made but it was a great way to see that I was getting better.

I was getting more done and I was better at seeing the positives.

Being able to find even a small thing to be grateful for is a gift.

### Starting a business

There are so many hurdles to overcome in starting a business that being able to focus on the positive is a useful skill.

I'm going to start adding a 'business gratitude' section to my journal.

Persistance is really difficult if you don't have compassionate support. And I want to support myself.
