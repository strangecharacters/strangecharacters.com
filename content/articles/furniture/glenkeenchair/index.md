Design a chair inspired by my grandfather's old farm in the Irish countryside.

Use the ideas from the Sligo or Tuam chair.

Build the first version using tools available in the college workshop.

Iterate and improve it until it becomes a beautiful, modern chair that represents a happy memory of an Irish childhood.


4 legs bad, 3 legs better.
Helps it stand out from others, links it with Irish heritage.

Wide open spaces
Try to avoid too much bracing on the lower legs, keep an arch or negative space visible underneath - typical of modern chairs / newer materials.

Armrests which can reinforce the structure.

Comfort - upholstered seat and good ergonomics.

## Prototype 1

### Model

Solid continuous back leg

No armrests

Flat, solid seat

3 legs, triangle shape for seat and armrest.


### Improvements

Some of my joinery just wasn't great. There's a joint with a large gap, filled in with glue.

The seat is flat, basic and the back rest is out of proportion with the rest of the chair.

Didn't think through in emough detail.
