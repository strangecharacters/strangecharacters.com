- Planning a holiday in Paris and visiting Musee D'Orsay, my wife said that she was eager to see some Modigliani, one of her favourite artists. 
    - I didn't have a favourite artist
- Joseph Wright of Derby
    - Who was he? His early life and training
    - Was he successful?
- Science [[Museum]] London had a large print
- What experiments are shown, who performed them?
- Science book in secondary school used the phosphorous picture
- The Royal Society, Natural Philosophers, The Baroque Cycle
- Tate Britain to see it in person
- Other paintings by him
- Who were his [[Contemporary]]'s ?
- https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Society_of_Birmingham
- My partner and I were planning our first holiday together. To be precise she was planning and I was happy to follow every one of her recommendations.
- We were going to Paris and she wanted to see the Musee D'Orsay
- >They have lots of Modigliani, he's one of my favourite painters
- And I thought to myself, who's my favourite painter. Do I have one?
- Do I even know any painters.
- Thanks to the Teenage Mutant ~~Ninja~~ Hero Turtles I could at least name a few classic artists. I wasn't a complete philistine, art was interesting to me but it was also impenetrable. I had never been to a gallery before, it was just sometihng arty people did. 
- My family would go on holidays and visit some of the castles and historical sites that Ireland was full of but never the galleries.
- We went to Paris, had a wonderful time and visited Orsay. There were amazing paintings and the building itself is spectacular. I could remember some names of artists and my partner pointed out her favourites. I loved it. But it still felt difficult to join in as such. It seemed everyone new more about art than I did.  And there was a lot to know. Impressionists, Secessionists, Cubists, Members of the pre-raphaelite brotherhood, pointilists. Which are are actual art movements and which are from science fiction? All of them (are art movements)
- I didn't study anything about art but I found that taking a guided tour was a brilliant help, placing art and artists in some kind of context. If I was brave enough to show my ignorance I could sometimes even ask questions.
- No one remembers just random details about art, we can remember the picture, the image but background and historical details are only remembered in the form of a story.
- More mesuems, more tours, more questions and I started to hear stories. 
- I visited the National Gallery in Dublin and heard the story of the Caravaggio that has sat on the walls of a priests house for decades incognito. The story of Caravaggio himself fleeing the city to avoid being arrested for mrdering someone. The same hands that could create art like this, used to kill someone.
- I still felt like an outsider to art and I enjyed something that felt a bit closer to my interests.
- The Science Museum in London. I wandered through the exhibits, especially enjoying anything space related.
- At the top floor near the escalator was a large image printed on the wall. 
- The topic was captivating to me: A science experiment. Why had no one else painted thing like this?
- I thought to myself - This is my favourite painting. I should find out more.
- [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] was an artist, a member of the Lunar Society and an artist.
