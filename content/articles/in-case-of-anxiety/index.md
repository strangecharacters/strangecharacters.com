### problem
Sometimes anxiety finds its way in through a crack and suddenly I'm useless. My brain tells me that something scary is happening.

When I'm anxious I'm not good at making decisions. I basically feel overwhelmed.
To make a good choice I need to have put in some work beforehand.

>What a wonderful thing to be able to stop when you know that you've planned something wrong -- Mr. Rogers

When does this happen?
some thing to worry about

choosing what I should do next

Mr. Anxiety and Dr. Calm

Lessons learned











Heart rate increases, I can't concentrate, Self-talk turns negative.



The systems for dealing with threat in our brains have to be quick. If we're being physically attacked there's no time to slowly evaluate. 

>Fear is half way around the world before logic has pulled on its boots.

But If I'm stressed about work I don't need adrenaline, twitchy muscles and tunnel vision.

That ancient fear response does nothing to help . 


### Prepare a freakout bag

Help it realise the best way to deal with the current problem.


The first rule of finding yourself stuck in a hole? Stop digging. Let's try not to make it worse.

Do I have any control over the thing I'm worried about?

Am I overwhelmed by the scale of a task?
Make it [smaller and smaller]() again until it's not scary.

Finding it too hard to decide which task to take on?
You need to soothe yourself. Make yourself feel safe so that you can use your whole self to decide, rather than just the fear part of the brain.

I find myself bouncing from task to task trying to get something done. I'm not able to focus on any one of them.
IN the evening after a day of anxiety I essentially give up. I'll get some dinner ready, chat to my partner and suddenly it becomes clear what I should have been doing.

### Mr. Anxiety and Dr. Calm

My calm brain is perfectly able to prioritise but my anxious brain is hopeless.
To get something done I need to sooth and calm first 

* Getting away from the computer is often useful

* Use paper to get ideas and worries out of your head onto paper

* Doing an active practice to remind you of a safe space / feeling

* Focusing on breathing and using that to calm the body



### evoke a real mistake with a personal story 

Tim Ferriss cheescake

I felt lonely
I went back to a terrible relationship

I felt powerless

Hindsight is 20/20. When I've done the wrong thing, it's easy to recognise that after the fact.
I felt sad, depressed.
I went and bought junk food in the hope that it would comfort me. It made me feel sick.


### Try to recognise what works
I found that doing some work in the garden made me feel better. 
When I'm overwhelmed I don't feel like doing gardening but if I can push through that I quickly find myself feeling better.
A menial physical task occupies my mind and my body and there's always a visible result from the work I've done.
I don't prejudge, I just have to repeat the steps and I end up getting it done

When I'm relaxing in the evening with my partner the pressure is gone and I'm suddenly able to plan and prioritise

On holidays it feels like I could work in the city I'm visiting and there wouldn't be any pressure
More locally, it sometimes feels great to work in a cool setting like a cafe or a library
These do feel like temporary boosts and probably not something I can do every day

Nobody wants to feel like this so we turn to something, anything to make us feel better. 
Junk food, alcohol, pornography, drugs. Or even nothing, just avoiding everything. I've felt the fear and gone to bed, overwhelmed in the middle of the day.
