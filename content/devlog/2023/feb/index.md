### What goes in the DevLog?
I write about where I've been spending my time and of it starts to stretch out into a few lines I'll probably break it out into an [article](/articles)

#### Changing work environment
Had to do some travelling by train and it felt good to work on sites in a different environment. 

I often feel energised by working in a new place. The background activity of a library / cofee shop / train seems to suit me. There's also the subtle pressure of being in public to keep me from dossing.

#### SSD Failure
Started this month with an unplanned project.
I got a cup of tea in the morning and turned my computer on to find 

/PXE error img/

The error indicates that the pc wasn't able to boot from the network. But it was only trying to boot from the network because it couldn't see any boot drive.

I opened the case and checked that the drives hadn't come physically loose ( they hadn't )

Then I created a live usb with linux so that  I could boot from an external drive.

I could list all the files on my boot (C:/) drive and all the files on my storage drive (D:/) as if nothing was wrong.

Restarting the machine gave the same error as before.

I thought if I can see the files but can't boot there must be something wrong with the boot sector of the drive so I created a windows installer on my usb drive.

Booting from that I tried to repair my windows installation but the installer had no success. 

I couldn't see what the problem was but I was resigned to reinstalling windows entirely.

But first, save what I could from the C: drive.

With the linux live usb I listed the files I needed and tried to copy them onto a backup drive. ( I was juggling drives like a master at this stage ) but straight away - error messages.
All my sttepts at copying resulted in failure.

I had assumed everything on the C: drive was intact except for the boot sector but it seems the rot went a little deeper.

I finally found someone describing similar symptoms to mine and they were saying that the physical drive was corrupt and was likely to only get worse. 

Thankfully most of the content I wanted to keep wasn't on my C: drive and I decided to remove the drive altogether and reinstall windows on my remaining drives.

So now I have a working computer. 

#### Backing up and down
I found the files I was most concerned about were on github, google photos, steam and in gmail which was helpful in this case but did make me think if I ever lost those accounts i'd be pretty screwed. I need to copy content down from the cloud as well as up. 

#### Starting this blog
Getting this blog up and running. Some small reorganistaion of folders, finding some images on [unsplash](https://unsplash.com)

#### Bullet Journaling
I got a gift of a new bullet journal for Christmas and started using it shortly after. 
I really dislike having stickers on my laptop but I'm perfectly happy putting them on the journal. I go through more than 1 a year so maybe it'll help tell them apart.

I'm not doing any elaborate bulleting but I am finding it useful to be able to step away from the computer and do some planning steps with just the notebook. It feels good to separate *adding to the todo list* from *working on the todo list* 

### Media
Listening to podcasts or watching youtube - if it's really interesting or helpful I will take notes.

and then procrastinate.

But having taken some notes does make it easier for it to resurface.

I enjoyed [You are not so smart]()
* A college cohort is given a time limited sales task on their very first day. Selling as much ice cream as they can in 2 hours. Some will fail, others will have orders of magnitude more success but everyone in the group gets immediate lessons in what worked and what didn't.
