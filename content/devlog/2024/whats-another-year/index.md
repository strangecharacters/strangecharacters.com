I'm an irregular blogger and I've left gaps between posts before.

This time around it's for a different, **better** reason.

Instead of procrastinating and paralysed, I've been busy.

An online friend asked me what I did for a living - at the time I was unemployed and I felt a bit embarassed saying so.
He immediately asked me 
>What do you **want** to do? 

No shame, just a nice open question.

So I've spent a while thinking about what to do, what would be my ideal job, what would make me happy.
And the thing that looked most interesting was something like product design.

Being able to imagine and iterate until you have a solution to a problem felt exciting

I had tried woodwork as a hobby and the idea of combining a hands on, practical craft with some imaginative, creative part really appealed to me.


### The 'ol college try

So I went back to a local college to study Furniture Design and Making. 

I hadn't been in college since the previous millenium and I had a pretty bad time back then. I was anxious, I fell behind and by the time I dropped out I felt embarassed and stupid.

This time I discovered amazing techniques like **study skills** and **being consistent**.

Lecturers were nice and supportive and while I definitely worried about repeating mistakes, going in and working with my hands, doing woodwork and metalwork felt really good.

I often felt bad talking about work - I didn't have a career, just temporary work or none at all.
But being a student felt great - people reacted really positively when I told them I was studying something crafty and practical.

I felt proud of it, which was a feeling I'd not had in quite a long time.


Doing work in college week on week helped my mindset at home and with other projects too. I started doing some DIY and being more social. 

I promised I wouldn't talk about plans on this blog, focusing on what I actually get done but I am hoping to blog more often now that I am getting more done. Let's see how it goes.

### Scrobbling Breadcrumbs 

I forget a lot of things, so I want to have a simple record of what I've been watching, doing, reading playing [our work is never over]
Audio scrobbling almost became a thing a few years ago and while I don't see it often anymore the name is still great.

I'm using [/media](/media) to record the events, music, movies and books that I'm enjoying.


### Gratitude Journal

A habit that fell a bit by the wayside that I'm starting to get back into. Leuchterm 1917 A5 dotted notebooks are my favourite.

### Guitar, Gaming and gardening

Picked up the guitar for the first time in months and could remember some basics but need to work on fundamentals. There's a long queue of songs that I'd like to be able to play.

Playing PUBG, Helldivers 2 and Control 

I've cut grass and built a shed for storage, done some basic tidying. Planted parsley and have a mighty rosemary bush in  a raised bed.
