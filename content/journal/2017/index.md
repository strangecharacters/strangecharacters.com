**A little life** and **The people in the trees** by Hanya Yanagihara. Both books are sometimes grim, always interesting and incredibly well written.

**How children succeed** How can children overcome difficulties and develop perseverance, curiosity and self-control?

**We need to talk about Kevin** Terrifying, tense.

**The fortunes of Africa** 

**The killing** Novelisation of the hit series, an excellent whodunnit.

**Fictions** by Jorge Luis Borges. Fantastic short stories.

**The handmaid's tale** 

**The goldfinch**

**The case for working with your hands**
