**Journey under the midnight sun** opens with a murder case and follows numerous characters over the subsequent years as you slowly close in on the culprit. One of my favourite thrillers of all time.

**Einstein** Looked up Walter Isaacson after reading his Steve Jobs biography and enjoyed this biography as well.
