#### Carmina Burana
Brussels Philharmonic, Vlaams Radiokoor
![Brussels philharmonic, Flagey](../PXL_20240623_141204417.jpg)
Opening and closing with the epic 'O Fortuna' performed by three choirs and a full orchestra

>O Fortuna
velut luna
statu variabilis,
semper crescis
aut decrescis;

>O Fortune,
like the moon
you are changeable,
ever waxing
ever waning;

Orff based the text on [Carmina Burana], a collection of poems and texts from the 11th and 12th centuries.
There was a talk with one of the choir directors before the show ( in English ) who mentioned they made an effort to pronounce german latin sounds rather than the more familiar 'italian latin'. 

In the lobby after the concert there was a 'wheel of fortune' you could spin to try and win a prize. 

#### Maison Hannon and House Horta 
Exceptional examples of Art Nouveau architecture in Brussels, less than 10 minutes walk from each other.
![House Horta, Brussels](../PXL_20240622_121751027.jpg)
Photographs were not permitted in the Horta house and we had to leave phones and cameras in a locker at reception. It is possible to take pictures if you organise prior approval apparently.

Hannon house had wonderful staff, very helpful. They gave us a booklet which cost 2 euros but said 'Just give it back when you leave and you won't have to pay anything'

### Hey Jealousy - The Gin Blossoms

1992 'New Miserable Experience'
Written by Doug Hopkins

I'm trying to learn this on guitar
* [Ryan Lendt - Campfire version](https://www.youtube.com/embed/iOHi7kSU1po?si=p2SkpqBt6f71EaPK)

The original lyrics used the line 
>You can trust me not to drink 

Doug struggled with alcoholism and was fired from the band at the end of the recording sessions.
The band used the more radio-friendly 
>You can trust me not to __think__

Doug tragically committed suicide in 1993

### Star Trek Picard S02
I'm not sure about this, it certainly doesn't feel like ST:TNG.

## July
### Female Impressionists in the National Gallery
![Impressionist painting of Eugene Manet and his daughter - Berthe Morisot](../PXL_20240716_152202250.jpg)
Berthe Morisot
>In 1882 when Morisot was in Nice, she wrote to Eugene at home in Paris asking him to select her submissions for the seventh Impressionist exhibition. She was astonished to learn that he included this painting, which was not one of her immediate choices.

![The Lady in White - Marie Bracquemond](../IMG_20240716_163052.jpg)
Marie Bracquemond
> Her meticulous technique meant that her painting process was time-consuming and her oeuvre realtively small. Bracquemond mostly worked at home in Sevres, using her sister, Louise, as her model.

![The Letter - Mary Cassatt](../IMG_20240716_162719.jpg)
Mary Cassatt
>Wealthy, independent and single, Cassatt lived a long and productive life. Throughout her career, Cassatt was actively involved in supporting women's rights, education and suffrage.

Anthony Horowitz
