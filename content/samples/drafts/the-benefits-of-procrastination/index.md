Why do I procrastinate when I want to get things done?

### History

I've been an excellent procrastinator for years now. It's the kind of thing that everyone does at some point but it feels like a real long term problem for me.
I dropped out of college because I couldn't organise myself to study or complete classwork.
I've left a job because I couldn't keep up with my responsibilities. My boss was very understanding and asked me why I couldn't get tihngs done but I didn't really have an answer.
I just kept getting distracted and I felt like I was going in circles. 
In jobs where tasks were specific and repetitive I got on fine but what I'd really like to be doing is working in somwthing creative.
Writing code, making computer games or building things. 
But I haven't gotten much done. Progress is either painfully slow or non existant.

When I'm planning I like to use a notebook to write down ideas. I've found old notebooks with ideas for webistes from more than 10 years ago that just never happened. Things that still seem like good ideas to me now that were never implemented, never even started properly.

I've done years in therapy abd that's helped lots of aspects of my life but even with big improvements in some things
procrastination is still my companion. My bully.

There seems to be a threshold for me. If I get into a project I can keep focused on it for a decent amount of time. Writing ideas can gel together and I can be productive.

My fear has always been about starting - a lack of confidence and finishing - a fear of judgement 
The bit in the middle when I have my head down beavering away, that's pretty good. A flow state, focus or just getting into the rhythm of a repetitive task.

Looking at ADHD symptoms I seem to fit quite a few of them. BUt whether I get diagnosed or not I think I need to work on skills that can help me get things done.

### What don't I procrastinate about?

If I am avoiding a task I often flee towards cooking or baking. Things to do on the computer or in the garden? Time to turn on the oven and start mamking some pastry. Sometimes this is a last gasp effort to produce something by the end of the day. If there's a meal on the table I can say that I made something. 

I don't feel a fear about cooking. Maybe because it's somehow separate from habits and fears from home? I didn't need to learn how to cook until I moved away. I often cooked for my flatmates and now for my partner and they appreciate it. I have a routine of cooking and then being praised for it. 

Reading isn't much of a task, it's something I use to relax at the end of the day so I don't have any feelings of it being imposed on me. THere's no way of failing at reading I suppose

### Benefits of procrastination

Procrastination is actually a great way of avoiding fear and stress. Have to start something that you don't feel confident about?
Put it off.
Got a task you are scared to start?
Do something, anything else intead and then you don't have to deal with it.

Sometimes if you procrastinate the problem will actually go away. Someone else will step in and do it for you. You'll be regarded as unreliable and people won't ask you to do anything ever again.
You'll drop out of college or lose your job and have have fewer things forced on you.

### Overcoming Procrastination

This is what we really want, right? Reading and understanding is fine and dandy but this is making our lives worse and we all want to beat this problem.

##### Observe our feelings

Fear of failure
Who is going to judge you? specifically
##### Set up for success
Start often, make it easy.
When I didn't __immediately __know what step to take next I procrastinated.
Make the task small enough that you know how it will end
Make it easy to start back into a project. I don't want to be face with a cliff to climb, I want to see a single step that gets me back on the path.

##### Planning
One source of planning.
If you improve how you deal with the negative emotions you'll be able to start more often
Planning your tasks will allow you to make each step in the right direction. Spoonfeed yourself the correct choices.

I like the tactility of using a paper notebook and a simple version of the bullet journal method. My thoughts are often racing so slowing down to makes notes phydically with a pen helps a lot.
Asking people for advice doen't ususally help. 
Just do it


Procrastination is not a time management problem, it's an emotional problem.

The desire to switch away from anything that's scary.


Procrastination is quick off the mark. Procrastination will be half way around the world while your plans are still pulling on their trousers.

>We procrastinate when we fear a threat to our self-worth. 
>... to temporarily relieve deep inner fears
>Procrastination rewards us with temporary relief from stress

> The more complex and varied your sense of self the less likely you are to become depressed over stress in one area **"because you have these uncontaminated areas of your life that can act as buffers"**.

>The childlike side of her once felt caught between the need for approval from authorities and her need to express her fear and her power through procrastination.

Using procrastination to express power over your fears. 

### Personal
The imposition is one of the things that makes me feel scared and that a very broad and common situation to be in. 
So it would seem that I should feel better if I'm self motivated, but that doesn't get rid of the fear of failure. And failing on my own is another very scary thing.
