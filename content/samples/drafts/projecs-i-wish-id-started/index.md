* Not for workaholics (within reason) 

I've struggled with anxiety for years and I have to know my limits when it comes to work.

* Asynchronous
One of the main attractions of working for yourself is the ability to set you own schedule. Being able to meet friends and share time with my partner isn't something I want to miss out on.
I don't want to sell my time, I want to sell my effort. Make something that doesn't require me to be present in order to hnelp a customer.



* Starting with few skills
I don't want to wait to start a business. I need to use the skills I do have to make a start.
If I wait until I __feel__ ready, I'll never be ready. 
>Perfect is the enemy of the good

* Benefits in kind
What if I fail?

I ask myself this question all the time, incessantly even.
My answer is that whatever project I take on, I will learn something.
Programming, a language, marketing, making friends, doing my taxes.


* Some social benefit


>I've been dreaming about starting a business for years and have filled notebooks with plans. 

>I can't start __any__ kindof business, it has to be one that fits my skills and interests. 
It has to be one that fits my lack of skills.

>I'm not a workaholic, I love to focus on a project that I care about but if I spend too much time on it I'm guaranteed to burn out.

#### Vampire Survivors

#### Subsurface Circular

#### Overboard by Inkle

This project stood out to me as a computer game that was developed in just 9 months.

The Developers had a number of projects under their belt ( 80 days, Heaven's Vault, Sorcery)
and they used the tools from those games to get a head start.

#### Blackthorn Prod Games and Content

A game developer with a few extra income streams.
Blackthorn Prod has released X games on steam but from their own reports it seems that most of their earning come from courses about game developemnt and ad revenue from the youtube channel.

#### Adam Wathan and Tailwind CSS

Adam built tailwind to scratch his own itch and released it as open source for anyone to use.
It's become incredibly popular and now he's launched a library of ready to use tailwind components for people to purchase. 

The sale price is $250 

#### Nathan Barry and Authority

Selling content that will help people earn money 

##### Substack

#### WaniKani by Tofugu

#### Content

##### Anne-Laure Le Cunff's Brain Trust
