first sighting

JW of Derby
interest in art 


<!--more-->
I wasn't even in an art gallery when I first saw what is now my favourite painting.

At the top of the escalator in the Science Museum was a large print 
showing a circle of people gathered around some kind of apparatus.
Lit by a candle they were witness to a science epxeriment.
Some were fascinated leaning in to see every detail. ~~Others appalled by the cruelty as~~ a bird, trapped in a glass jar struggles to breathe as air is removed. The children turn away, not wanting to see.

I was captivated by this painting. 

A couple of years before my partner and I were planning our first holiday in Paris together. She planned to visit the Musee D'Orsay
>They have lots of Modigliani, he's one of my favourite painters

And I thought to myself, who's my favourite painter. Do I have one?
Do I even know any painters?
I wasn't a complete philistine, art was interesting to me but it was also impenetrable. I had never actually been to a gallery before, it was just something arty people did. 

We went to Paris, had a wonderful time and visited Orsay. There were amazing paintings and the building itself is spectacular. I could remember some names of artists and my partner pointed out her favourites. I loved it. But it still felt difficult to join in as such. It seemed everyone new more about art than I did. ~~ And there was a lot to know. Impressionists, Secessionists, Cubists, Members of the pre-raphaelite brotherhood, pointilists.~~

The Science Museum in London. I wandered through the exhibits, especially enjoying anything space related.
At the top floor near the escalator was a large image printed on the wall. 
The topic was captivating to me: A science experiment. Why had no one else painted thing like this?
I thought to myself - This is my favourite painting. I should find out more.




- [[Joseph Wright of Derby]] was an artist, a member of the Lunar Society and an artist.


I didn't study anything about art but I found that taking a guided tour was a brilliant help, placing art and artists in some kind of context. If I was brave enough to show my ignorance I could sometimes even ask questions.
No one remembers just random details about art, we can remember the picture, the image but background and historical details are only remembered in the form of a story.
More museums, more tours, more questions and I started to hear stories. 
I still felt like an outsider to art and I enjyed something that felt a bit closer to my interests.
