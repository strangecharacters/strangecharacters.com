## Design Challenges
### Plastic Bottle Challenge

Design an object and make a prototype using plasic bottles.

#### Research
* Using bottles as planters for seedlings
![green wall using plastic bottles for plants](d2v4lj8i.png)

* Watertight container for camping - firelighting supplies

* Roof light - when filled with water the bottle acts like a fibre optic
![roof light plastic bottle](qcgm5ojo.png)
https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/dec/23/sunlight-bulbs-plastic-bottles-light



![plastic bottles used as mouse mat](lozp5w57.png)

There were a variety of bottles with different shapes and colours which helped inspire different ideas.

I had an orangina bottle which had an interesting curve which made me think of using it in some ergonomic way.

#### Evaluation
The product could work as intended, the shape provided support for the wrists.

Not all of the bottle was used - finding a way to make something simple like a desktop pencil holder from the leftovers would have been good.

I wasn't very imaginative with the modifications I made. I just used the bottle shape. Robin for example used his to make some cute toy animal shapes by cutting roatiating and taping back together.

Using a waterproof material inspired lots of people to make outdoor gardening realted items.


### Tallest tower
In teams of 3 build the tallest tower.
1 hour.

A4 paper, scissors, knife - no glue, no tape.

We tried out different shapes for a structure with the basic idea of having lots of them bunched together so that we could build up lots of layers.

It was difficult to make rectangular shapes strong so we moved towards making cylinders.

Cutting the end of the cylinders and tucking in the ends allowed them to stay in shape and gave us a good element to work with.

They were small and to reach a big height we needed lots of them.

We didn't have a good way to bind them together.

In experimenting, we did end up with some decorative pieces as well.

After the time limit I thought of snipping a fringe into a long piece of paper and that could be used to tuck into the cylinders joining them up in groups - too late :(

### Bridge project

Build a bridge from paper ( 3 sheets of A4 ) and masking tape ( one piece as long as an outstretched arm ) that can support a brick.
The bridge is free standing, not attached to either end.

![tightly would cylinder](66iwl6wd.png)
![folded sheets of paper](usca0ibl.png)
![suspension bridge](gqk0nedh.png)

I found this challenge difficult, I was unsuccessful and the process was difficult as well.

I kept thinking that there was a 'fancy' solution that I wasn't seeing. Something elaborate like a suspension bridge or an origami fold.
As time went on I saw people who were successful had just experimented with the paper and used its properties
 - rolling it up really tightly, using the tape to make small pieces as strong as possible.

 My efforts made for wide or big pieces that just weren't strong enough. I also tried to use the strength of the paper a bit like a rope bridge but without anything to secure it to either end it wasn't going to work.

 I should have tried making strong pieces via experiments and then seeing it they could be joined together or improved. I was trying things as if I had a piece of wood to build with.

 Fail - have to bring my brick via ferry from now on.

## Gerrit Rietveld - Canva Poster 

![Geerrit Rietveld Poster](<Gerrit Rietveld.png>)

### Notes for Presentation
Gerrit Rietveld was born in Utrecht in the Netherlands in 1888.
His father was a joiner and Gerrit left school at 11 to become an apprentice with his father.
He later went to night school and started his own furniture business. He was interested in designing things that could be mass
produced. He became part of 'De Stijl' (The Style) art movement, founded in 1917. One of his early success was the red and blue chair. 
He wanted to give the impression of the seated person floating.
Originally unpainted beech he choose the red and blue colours after being inspired by fellow De Stijl artist Piet Mondrian.

![Piet Mondrian](1s9tt19f.png)

He was invited to exhibit at the Bauhaus in Germany.

Another iconic design was the Zig Zag chair.
Designed for the Schroeder House in 1930 it was inspired by works from Mies van der Rohe and Marcel Breuer. It uses dovetail joinery and metal bolts to keep together the angled pieces but has been described as 'surprisingly comfortable'.

He was commissioned in 1924 to design a house for Frau Schroeder and he wanted to achieve a look of floating elements and an upstairs with a completely open plan.
His initial designs were rejected by Frau Schroeder but the final design was built and still exists. The balcony and outer walls were meant to look disconnected, without showing where they connect to the main structure.
As requested by his client the upper floor has a number of movable panels so that rooms can be reconfigured with only the bathroom remaining fixed.
Despite Frau Schroeder not owning a car he insisted on including a garage.



## Collection of Work -- Woodworking Projects
### Woodworking Jig
Create a jig that holds a piece of wood at an angle so it can be passed through the thicknesser.

The jig needs to 
* fit inside the thicknesser, not get cut when it is used
* not move when the piece is passed through
* keep the piece at a stable angle

#### Making the jig

#### Health and Safety
##### Tools Used
* Drill
    * Drill is stored with the direction button set in the middle position so that it won't operate immediately on picking it up.
* Planer / Thicknesser
    * Thicknesser needs key to operate.
    * Extractor vent is opened with other vents for other machines closed.
    * Hearing protection used at all times.
    * safety glasses.
    * Never putting hands inside the frame of the machine.
    * Identifying emergency stop in case it's needed.

<p>I definitely chose some awkward angles and shapes for the joints.
I should have practised before trying them, perhaps figured out some jigs that would have simplified things.</p>
<p>The ash plank had a piece of live edge which could have been avoided in cutting but I didn&rsquo;t notice it when I marked it up. Since I was using 1 long piece as the back leg I had to incorporate the live egde into the design</p>
<p>My drawings were incomplete. I was making a few changes to my plans and didn&rsquo;t draw those changes onto new plans. This compounded some of my problems.</p>
<p>There was quite a bit of time pressure as well. I missed a few classes but I was also quite hesitant in putting things together, again having practised some joints and techniques would probably have helped.</p>
<p>I have a poor joint between the back leg and one side of the trangular frame. I filled the gap with (lots of) extra glue so structurally it&rsquo;s probably fine but it&rsquo;s definitely very visible.</p>
<p>My front legs are not prefectly square either. Having 3 legs which will always find a stable position was a good choice it seeems.</p>
<p>I still like the design but would rethink my joinery if I was to make it again.</p>

#### Health and Safety
Tools used

* Thicknesser / Planer
    * Planer
        * Keeping the blade cover over most of the blade
        * Using pushstick to move the workpiece
    * Thicknesser
        * Thicknesser needs key to operate.
        * Never putting hands inside the frame of the machine.    
    * Hearing protection used at all times.
    * safety glasses.    
    * Identifying emergency stop in case it's needed.
    * Extractor vent is opened with other vents for other machines closed.



* Router Table
    * Hearing protection
    * Goggles
    * Hands clear at either side of the router bit
    * Using pushstick to move the piece near the router bit
    * Featherboard on the table to keep the piece in position
    * Featherboard on the fence to hold the work piece down
    * Dust extraction working and vents for other machines closed

* Bandsaw
    * Hearing protection
    * Goggles
    * Dust extraction
    * Pushstick to keep the slips against the fence and to finish pushing each piece through

* Domino
    * Hearing protection
    * Goggles
    * Connected to portable dust extractor
    * Hold machine flat against the surface to be dominoed using handles at front and back
    * Using machine left-handed was difficult, much easier to switch on safely while using right hand
    * Took care to tidy cables on floor as there was both power and air lines coming from the portable extractor
